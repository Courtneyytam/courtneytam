                    Ads Manager is Facebook’s ads creation and management tool that enables businesses to manage when and where ads will run and to track how they are performing.  However, the lack of an onboarding experience heightened the disparity between a new user’s cognitive ability and the challenging tasks performed resulting in a severe drop-off rate. Therefore this project aims to create a design prototype used for research and testing purposes to learn how Ads Manager can improve their new user experience. <br/> <br/> <strong> Note:</strong> Final designs have been modified and research findings have been redacted in compliance to my NDA.

                Our goal is to set the advertiser up for success by reducing ambiguity around initial tasks and to ease their confusion around how Facebook Ads are created in Ads Manager. </div>

            <p class="section-title">What does success look like?</p><div class="section-text">
                The final solution of the new user onboarding experience is heavily reliant on the assumption that success is launching an ad campaign.

             <div class="section-text">The design solution that emerged from the design methods applied was a linear general setup flow that first allowed new users to complete core tasks such as adding a Facebook page and payment method to their Ads Manager account. Once completed, the user will be introduced to their Account Overview surface where educational resources are provided to support their first ad creation experience. The following figure describes the step by step flow which a new user will be guided through.

                    <li>Decoupling of core tasks and key actions increases guidance and user focus </li>

                    <li>Merging ‘Campaign Trends’ empty state with the ‘Campaign Creation’ onboarding step allows new users to revisit helpful tips if they encounter the empty state again</li>

Following this, two types of usability testing that were conducted (unmoderated remote usability testing and contextual inquiry testing) on various onboarding flows. </div>

             <div class="section-text">This project adequately addressed the platform problem by designing an onboarding experience and addressed the user problem by surfacing educational resources. The solution to the platform problem was then proven successful through user research studies, although more rigorous testing with a larger sample.
