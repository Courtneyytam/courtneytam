                    Asset Data Insight (ADI) allows oil and gas engineers to monitor and optimize the performance of various equipment within an industrial plant. Enabling engineers to indicate a threshold on the timeseries of an equipment is essential in the monitoring process. Additionally, a corresponding alert is necessary to communicate to the engineer when a threshold has been triggered. This project aims to simplify and streamline the process in which engineers set up thresholds and complex alerts within ADI.

            <p class="major-title">Background</p>
            <P class="section-text">Asset Data Insight (ADI) is Cognite’s Data Platform to stores timeseries data for industrial plants. The timeseries data describes the performance and states of various equipment pieces within a plant. For example, one timeseries may be associated for a component within a pump indicating the pressure over time. ADI has previously focused on analyzing historic timeseries data where the focus was on identifying equipment issues to schedule upcoming maintenance. As ADI moves into the real-time monitoring space alerting functionality is essential.

                Our goal is to design a robust threshold and alert creation process which is straightforward and set up and clear to understand for process engineers. <br/><br/>

                <ul class="section-list">
                    <li>Enabling the engineer to set up multiple thresholds per timeseries to indicate the health status of the equipment (i.e. warning range, danger, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Thresholds must be viewable on both scatterplots and line charts</li>
                    <li>Automated alerting system when a threshold is triggered</li>
                    <li>Alerting the correct personnel when a threshold is triggered (i.e. the engineer who set up the threshold and the on-site engineer)</li>
                    <li>A single alert can be triggered by multiple thresholds (AND/OR operators)</li>

            <p class="section-title">1. Research</p>
            <div class="section-text">A competitor analysis was conducted to gain knowledge of how other monitoring software create thresholds and alerts (ex. Grafana Dashboards). Furthermore, academic and non-academic HCI research was analyzed on how engineers monitor equipment manually in a control room (i.e. monitoring the pin on a pressure valve). Using thematic coding, descriptive and interpretive codes were generated which were then used to identify key tasks and common pain points. </div>


            <p class="section-title">2. Observation and User Interviews</p>
            <div class="section-text">To get first hand knowledge from our target users, the design team shadowed process engineers onsite at an industrial plant and conducted user interviews. Below lists a few interesting findings:
				<ul class="section-list">
                    <li>When monitoring the exact reading from a sensor is not critical</li>
                    <li>Setting up thresholds for a timeseries is non-iterative (generally set up once) whereas alerts are often reconfigured multiple times</li>
                    <li>Alerts need to go to different people using different methods during different time periods and days of the week (i.e. day shift vs. night shift workers)</li>

             <div class="section-text">Studying engineering at school was extremely beneficial in closing the knowledge gap between myself and our end users, however, there were times where I allowed my academic background to cause an unconscious bias. Although engineering concepts are theoretically the same, I overlooked the differences caused by culture; Norwegian vs. North American. Some mathematical syntax which I initially believed were universal were not used by our Norwegian customers. Therefore testing in this design process was crucial in helping me overcome my bias to design an end product that is appropriate for our Norwegian users.</div>
